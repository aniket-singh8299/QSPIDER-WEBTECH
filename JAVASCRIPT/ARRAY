ARRAY IS a continuous block of memory
In jS,  Array is HETEROGENOUS in Nature(means different types of data like function,string,int,object,nested array) not same(like string HOMOGENOUS)
IN JS WE CREATE ARRAY IN TWO WAYS
1) ARRAY LITERALS
2) BY USING AN ARRAY CONSTRUCTOR (Using New Keyword:- to create a object)

In Array Constructor (when we pass value than it will create empty*10) and pass string than it will give array element and if we will give boolean than it will give element
BUT IF WE pass multiple value than it will consider as array elements
   
IN JS, ARRAY LENGTH IS NOT FIXED




ALWAYS USE CONST VARIABLE RATHER THAN VARIBALE BECAUSE OF SECURITY




//Hoisting is possible in which type of function

//Function Hoisting possible where we not initalize with variable-



//ADVANCE ARRAY METHODS

1) ForEach()
2) Map()
3) Filter()
4) Reduce()
5) find()


1) ForEach:-
